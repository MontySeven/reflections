What happens when you initialise a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created that will track the changes to the repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it adds?
Gives you more power to commit only certain changes?  Not really sure.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can make more than one change but only commit certain lines.  Much more control over what you are comitting.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organised?  How would branches help?
For when there would be a potential fork in software, perhaps for trying something out that you are not sure would work but want to try without editing the main code.

How do Diagrams help you visualise the branch structure?
They give you a visual representation of the branch log.

When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When its work you'd want to share with the world or for teams working together on a project.

Changes on remote by someone else that you're not ready to pull through to yours (eg.)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
clone - copy of entire repository including all history and branches
branch - something within a repository.  Represents a thread of development.
fork - copy source to your own master.  Change direction or to have write access and submit as patch.

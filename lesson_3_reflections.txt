When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When its work you'd want to share with the world or for teams working together on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Changes on remote by someone else that you're not ready to pull through to yours (eg.)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programer in the long term?
It'll hopefully make me much faster and better and this skill I'm trying to learn

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically, saved like in Goodle Docs does?
The changes would make logical sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
When a change affects more than one file that would be useful.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
To view the change history on a file and the compare two file version differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can go back to versions before the break with ease and compare what's changed to help identify the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Doing to web dev code! :)
